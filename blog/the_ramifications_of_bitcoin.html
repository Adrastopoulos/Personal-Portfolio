        <h2>The Ramifications of Bitcoin</h2>
				<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>
					Bitcoin first achieved parity with the U.S. dollar in 2011. Now, it fluctuates by thousands of dollars every day.
					<br>
					Now, almost everyone with a digital bank participates in a cryptocurrency trade, crossing their fingers in hopes of striking it rich in the next bull run.

        <h3>The Dark Side of the World's Largest Cryptocurrency</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin operates on the block-chain, meaning that a complex network of networks must operate constantly to verify transactions against the block-chain. This, along with the high volume of miners, demands a high toll on both energy and hardware industries. <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume" target="_blank">(source)</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Justifications</h3>
        <p>
          The takeaway very much depends on how you feel about Bitcoin. Is it no more than a device for money-laundering, or is it a legitimate decentralized currency, free from government regulation and artificial inflation?
